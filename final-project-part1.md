## Summary
In terms of esports, League of Legends (LOL) is one of the largest and most popular games ever. As a league of legends player myself, I want to put together a guide for fans and young LOL players who are interested in becoming a professional player to make sense of what the professional LOL world looks like. The project will touch upon the impact of LOL, overview of LOL pro players, regional differences, and ways to become a professional player. 

### Part 1 - Impact of LOL

In this section, I will talk about the influence of LOL, including the global market, esport influence, and future of esport. 

Global Market: Here will be a Bar chart showing the LOL revenue

Esport influence: League of Legends esports viewership reached 5 147 701 Peak Viewers record in 2022.

Future of esport: Besides the huge revenue and popularity ahead, Esport has also taken the first big step into the realm of traditional games. In Asian Games 2018 held in Indonesia, five esports, including LOL, were included as demonstration titles. In Asian Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China will be the first edition of the Asian Games to feature esports as a medal sport. Medals are to be on offer in the Arena of Valor, Dota 2, Dream Three Kingdoms, FIFA 23, HearthStone, League of Legends, PUBG Mobile and Street Fighter V. 

### Part 2 - Overview of LOL pro players
What is it like to be a pro player? In part II we will discuss the tournaments,  income, ways of earnings, training daily routine, and commercial obligations.

Tournaments and Annual Timeline:

Ways of Earning:
I’m planning to make a pie chart about the estimated proportion of Earning categories, but I am still digging into the data.

Team Salary
Sponsorship
Streaming
Tournament Earning

Daily Training Routine of a player:

### Part 3 - Regional differences
For this section I will delve into the differences between LOL leagues. Specifically, part 3 will focus on the 4 major leagues: LCK (Korea), LPL (China), LEC (Europe), and LCS (North America). The 4 leagues will be evaluated from several perspectives, including competitiveness (championship history), average income, and career length.

Competitiveness:
<img width="421" alt="International Tournaments Counts" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101654251/203792354-050c783f-6c96-4cdc-aeda-825511f279d9.png">
LCK and LPL win a lot more tournaments than LEC and LCS. If victory and honor is important to you, you should consider being part of LCK or LPL

Average Income: LCS has a higher average team salary, when it comes to the top players, LEC players have the highest earnings. 

Career Length
In general, LCK and LPL are very competitive, which means you might be soon replaced by younger players. In contrast, LCK and LCS players have a longer average career.

Part 4 - Ways to become a professional player
The final section will walk through the path to become a professional player.

## Data
Player Money Ranking (https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/Portal:Statistics/Player_earnings)
This dataset includes information about player’s accumulative tournament numbers and earnings  since the first World Championship. I am planning to use it to create a bar chart of the top 20 highest earning players when speaking about the player incomes. One thing tricky about this dataset is that it divides players based on their nationality, so I cannot make direct comparisons between different leagues. Because it is very common for Korean-born players to play at LPL (Chinese League) and European players to play at LCS (North American league). 

Prize Pool (https://www.esportsearnings.com/games/164-league-of-legends)
I will be using this to create a chart to show the players prize pool in part II income section.

Esport Chart (https://escharts.com/games/lol)
It shows the all-time viewers peak of LOL as well as the relative rank among all esports. I will use it to show the increasing trend of popularity of LOL. 

Daily Routine (https://kslnewsradio.com/1917037/they-train-14-hours-a-day-7-days-a-week-chasing-million-dollar-paydays-meet-chinas-new-breed-of-esports-athletes/)
This article shows the regular training routine of a LOL team. I will use this to make a daily timeline, and highlight the 14 hours per day and 7 days per week.

List of MSI Winner (https://en.number13.de/list-of-all-msi-winners/)
List of Worlds Winner (https://www.esportsbets.com/league-of-legends/worlds/winners/)
Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and World Championship are the two international tournaments, the above tables show the list of past winners. I will make a bar chart to show the count of wins for each league.

## Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand to complete the final project. For graphs and charts, I will be mostly using tableau and infogram. Most of my data will be coming from Google Search and Statia. In terms of images, I am going to use free images provided by Shorthand. If necessary, I will also use the “tool” function of Google to find images under creative common license. All of the information for the final project will be documented in google docs aside from the github website.

I was researching for another project, and found this graph. I feel its idea is clear, and Standford university is a realiable source. 

## Sketch of a solution
<img width="431" alt="How Couples Met Sketch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101654251/202356151-c2cb62fa-4e5a-4fea-8b14-2c3a9b568581.png">
Note: I instantly thought of colring it differently with gray and other color to seperate online dating from the rest. Also get rid of the labels
on the left of the lines to reduce redundancies. Since it fouces on online dating, I felt the percentage of other variables were not important. Because
we can tell most of them are decreasing without number, and that is enough for this story.

## Test the Solution

Adult, early 50s

Can you tell me what you think this is?
A graph showing the percentage of different ways married people met

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
online dating is increasing

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I didn't know online dating has become such a big part

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Students? 

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I think it looks good, maybe too many words. And you really need to work on your handwritings. 


Student, early 20s
Can you tell me what you think this is?
A line chart of ways couple met's proportion

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
online dating is growing

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
It is clear to me

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Like out classmate 

Note: It is a goo idea to change the title, it helps to reducce the text and make the focus of this chart clearer.

## 

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would suggest a more informative title

Notes: I decided to use Tableau. I first created a excel sheet with all the data on the graph, and imported it. Then I followed my sketch, changed
the color, label, headline etc. I also learned myself to change the year variable to "discrete" to only shows 1995 and 2017. I also learned to add 
captions. And googled a few staffs we learned in class but I forgot about. Such as put the "ways of dating" to color, and mark points with annotate, 
as well as change the number of x-axis to percentage.

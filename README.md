# portfolio
This is my public portfolio of telling story with data

# About me
My name is Phoebe, a second year Arts Management Student. I don't have much coding experiences, but I always interested to learn more about coding and how to handle data in general.

# What I hope to learn
 I have some basic understanding such as to make a pie chart or draw a scatterplot with R, but this course shows some fundemental understanding of design thinking. Human takes in about 70% of information visually. So I want to learn different and more effective ways to communicate with audiences with infographics.

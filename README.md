This is my public portfolio of telling story with data

# About me
My name is Phoebe, a second year Arts Management Student. I don't have much coding experiences, but I always interested to learn more about coding and how to handle data in general.

# What I hope to learn
 I have some basic understanding such as to make a pie chart or draw a scatterplot with R, but this course shows some fundemental understanding of design thinking. Human takes in about 70% of information visually. So I want to learn different and more effective ways to communicate with audiences with infographics.

Different Visualizations Comparison:
The Government Debt Bar Chart is the countries' debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018, with Japan having the highest percentage of 234% of its GDP, compared to an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 79%. On the other hand, Estonia has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio of 13%. The graph makes it easy to compare the ratio of different countries in one year. It has a clearly labeled key, date, and source. Although it is not labeled explicitly, viewers can see each country's percentage by putting the mouse on each column. The highest and lowest percentage are colored in contradictory blue and red, while the average percentage is colored in black. The rest of the data are colored in an ashy blue. The paler blue grid in the background also saves attention on the columns. 

In comparison, the grid of the line chart reflects the debt-to-GDP trend for each country separately. Similarly, viewers can see the ratio for every country in every year by placing the mouse on the line. Some countries report less data than others, and the percentage is increasing for most countries. The third one is a grid bar chart, which combines information from the two charts above. Viewers can feel the volume of the ratio with the column representation and see the trend for each country over the years. Although it is still difficult to compare each country side by side compared to the first bar chart, the grid of charts is better at showing the all-around performance of individual nations throughout the years.

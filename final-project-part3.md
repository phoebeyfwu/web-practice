### Final Write-up
After completing Assignment 2, I thought through the advices I got so far, and reorganizaed my content. My page was a little text-heavy, so when I was building up the data story in shorthand, I trimed down text to only essential informations. To enrich the visuals, I got some icons from Noun Project, which was a source recommended in our class. I also used free images provided by Shorthand. Because there wasn't any images specific for League of Legends, I used Google Search Tools to find images under "Creative Common Liscences", and carefully read the terms to make sure I was allowed to "copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format", as long as I cited them. 

I also received a lot of great feedback about making comparison between esports and tradition sports or other high-salary occupations. In part 2, I found a report of the viewership of esports compare to traditional sports. But I wasn't quite sure about its given statistics, since it was a forcasting. Plus, I wanted to make a specific case about LOL. I had found data about LOL finals by years. So I serached the viwerships of eahc major sports league finals, and calculated the average viwerships by year manually (because most of their finals took place sveral days). 


However, because most team salary and streaming earning were behind the door, and drastically varied for top players and rookies -- it was hard to pinpoint a middle number.

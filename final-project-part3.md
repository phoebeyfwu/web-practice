### Final Data Story

### Final Write-up

After completing Assignment 2, I thought through the advice I had gotten so far and reorganized my content. My page was a little text-heavy, so when I built up the data story in Shorthand, I trimmed down the text to only essential pieces of information. To enrich the visuals, I got some icons from Noun Project, a source recommended in our class. I also used free images provided by Shorthand. Because there weren't any images specific to League of Legends, I used Google Search Tools to find images under "Creative Common Licenses." I also carefully read the terms to ensure I was allowed to "copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format" as long as I cited them. 

I also received great feedback from many about comparing esports and traditional sports or other high-salary occupations. In part 2, I found a report on the viewership of esports compares to traditional sports. But I wasn't quite sure about its given statistics since it was a forecasting. Plus, I wanted to make a specific case about LOL. I found data about LOL finals by the years. So I searched the viwerships of each major sports league finals and manually calculated the average viewerships by year (because most of their finals took place sveral days). 

Part of my process:

After getting all the numbers I want, I created a new line graph in Tableau, because I wanted to show both the number was getting close and its overall trend of increasing. Meanwhile, I decided to leave NFL out, because super bowl was just way above all other leagues (we were talking about 99 million vs 5 million). I highlighted LOL in purple, since I used purple for highlighting other parts, too. I also modified the color of prize pool share to difference shades of purples, to unify color was also an advice I received from part II.

Alongside the highest tournament prize earning, I also added the highest earning in 2022 to help people better make sense of how much a player can win in a year. 

I also considered comparing pro gamers' income to other occupations. However, because most team salaries and streaming earnings were behind the door and drastically varied for top players and rookies -- it was almost impossible to pinpoint a middle number. But I added more statistics, such as LCS's minimum and highest salary (League North American Division). In this part, I used a scrollpoint in design to make browsing more interesting. 

In addition, I took off the part of compart major LOL leagues, as I thought the narratives got too complicated for that. Then I changed my call to action. Initially, I planned to recommend one LCK team and one LPL team (Korean and Chinese Division). But it was harder than I thought. I did a lot of research, and Gen.G (a Korean team) had the highest market values so far. Yet there were so many different factors that can be considered, both quantitative and qualitative ones. For instance, T1 had the most stable performance in the making to the finals in the recent three years and the second highest market value of LCK. But they just renewed their contract with their star player Faker for 3 years. If you were also a mid laner, T1 would not be a good option. Similarly, for LPL, RNG was good at promoting their players but was famously known for getting in players' way when they tried to transfer to another team.

Therefore, I decided not to burn my head off and picked a more accessible call to action - introducing the steps to become a pro. I felt it was more helpful for people who wanted to start their careers because, in reality, you do not always get to choose which team you want to join. I also added more data and visuals and edited text for this section. Such as the Diamond 3 ranking means the top 2.8% of all gamers.

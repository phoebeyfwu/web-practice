### Final Write-up
After completing Assignment 2, I thought through the advices I got so far, and reorganizaed my content. My page was a little text-heavy, so when I was building up the data story in shorthand, I trimed down text to only essential informations. To enrich the visuals, I got some icons from Noun Project, which was recommended in our class. I also used free images provided by shorthand. Because there wasn't any images specific for League of Legends, I used Google Search Tools to find images under "Creative Common Liscences", and carefully read the terms to make sure I was allowed to "copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format", as long as I cited them. 

I also received a lot of feedback about making comparison. In part 2, I found a report of the viewership of esports compare to traditional sports. But because I was making the specific case of LOL, I put together a gragh of major sports league vs LOL. I then thought it would be good to show the trend through the years, since I already had the data of LOL finals by year.

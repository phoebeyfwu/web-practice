### Final Write-up

After completing Assignment 2, I thought through the advice I had gotten so far and reorganized my content. My page was a little text-heavy, so when I built up the data story in Shorthand, I trimmed down the text to only essential pieces of information. To enrich the visuals, I got some icons from Noun Project, a source recommended in our class. I also used free images provided by Shorthand. Because there weren't any images specific to League of Legends, I used Google Search Tools to find images under "Creative Common Licenses." I also carefully read the terms to ensure I was allowed to "copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format" as long as I cited them. 

I also received great feedback from many about comparing esports and traditional sports or other high-salary occupations. In part 2, I found a report on the viewership of esports compares to traditional sports. But I wasn't quite sure about its given statistics since it was a forecasting. Plus, I wanted to make a specific case about LOL. I found data about LOL finals by the years. So I searched the viwerships of each major sports league finals and manually calculated the average viewerships by year (because most of their finals took place sveral days). 

Part of my process:

After getting all the numbers I want, I created a new line graph in Tableau, because I wanted to show both the number was getting close and its overall trend of increasing. Meanwhile, I decided to leave NFL out, because super bowl was just way above all other leagues (we were talking about 99 million vs 5 million). I highlighted LOL in purple, since I used purple for highlighting other parts, too. I also modified the color of prize pool share to difference shades of purples, to unify color was also an advice I received from part II.

However, because most team salary and streaming earning were behind the door, and drastically varied for top players and rookies -- it was hard to pinpoint a middle number.

### Final Write-up
After completing Assignment 2, I thought through the advices I got so far, and reorganizaed my content. My page was a little text-heavy, so when I was building up the data story in shorthand, I cuted off most of it, only left the essential lines. In addition, I find some icons from noun project to enhance the visual components of the site.

I also received a lot of feedback about making comparison. In part 2, I found a report of the viewership of esports compare to traditional sports. But because I was making the specific case of LOL, I put together a gragh of major sports league vs LOL. I then thought it would be good to show the trend through the years, since I already had the data of LOL finals by year.

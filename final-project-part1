## Summary
In terms of esports, League of Legends (LOL) is one of the largest and most popular games ever. As a league of legends player myself, I want to put together a guide for fans and young LOL players who are interested in becoming a professional player to make sense of what the professional LOL world looks like. The project will touch upon the impact of LOL, overview of LOL pro players, regional differences, and ways to become a professional player. 

### Part 1 - Impact of LOL
In this section, I will talk about the influence of LOL, including the global market, esport influence, and future of esport. 

### Part 2 - Overview of LOL pro players
What is it like to be a pro player? In part II we will discuss the tournaments,  income, ways of earnings, training daily routine, and commercial obligations.

### Part 3 - Regional differences
For this section I will delve into the differences between LOL leagues. Specifically, part 3 will focus on the 4 major leagues: LCK (Korea), LPL (China), LEC (Europe), and LCS (North America). The 4 leagues will be evaluated from several perspectives, including competitiveness (championship history), average income, and career length.

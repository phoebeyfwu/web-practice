The idea of playing video games competitively as a salaried profession has yet to be taken seriously in mainstream culture. Yet today, being a professional gamer has become a real option with its ever-growing revenue, popularity, and opportunities. Regarding esports, League of Legends (LOL) is one of the most popular games ever. As a league of legends player, I want to put together a guide for fans and young LOL players interested in becoming professional players to make sense of what the professional LOL world looks like. The project will touch upon the impact of LOL, an overview of LOL pro players, regional differences, and ways to become a professional player.

League of Legend (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game, played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each player independently controls a powerful character, their "hero,‚Äù who has a unique ability and a differing style of play. 

If you are not already interested in electronic gaming, you may be surprised by just how big an industry eSports now is. In 2021, the total market value of the eSports industry hit the 1 million mark. Many of the top eSports players are celebrities to Millennial and Generation Z fans. To them, eSports is as legitimate a sport as football and basketball.

Meanwhile, League of Legends esports viewership reached 5,147,701 Peak Viewers record in 2022.

Compare to traditional high-income jobs, professional gamers make a decent living and, on some occasions, turn millionaires.

#### Future of esport 
Besides the huge revenue and popularity ahead, Esport has also taken the first big step into the realm of traditional games. In Asian Games 2018 held in Indonesia, five esports, including LOL, were included as demonstration titles. In Asian Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China will be the first edition of the Asian Games to feature esports as a medal sport. Medals are to be on offer in the Arena of Valor, Dota 2, Dream Three Kingdoms, FIFA 23, HearthStone, League of Legends, PUBG Mobile and Street Fighter V.

### Overview of a professional player
So What is it like to be a pro player? Here take a look of the tournaments,  income, ways of earnings, training daily routine, and commercial obligations.

Income Structures:

The income of LoL players include Team Salary, Sponsorship, Streaming, and Tournament Earning.

According to a 2021 survey conducted among 91 professional e-sports gamers within ten major South Korean e-sports teams, around 96.7% of respondents stated that receiving a salary was a source of income for them. Professional gamers employed by teams or collectives generally receive salaries alongside other, more flexible income source opportunities. The most common sources of irregular income among professional gamers was income generated from streaming, which can include donations, sponsorships, and advertising.

However, for those who are able to compete over championship, the reward is exponential:

### Regional differences
Once you become a professional player, you might want to know what divisions you want to play for. There are 4 major leagues: LCK (Korea), LPL (China), LEC (Europe), and LCS (North America). The 4 leagues will be evaluated from several perspectives, including competitiveness (championship history), average income, and career length.

Competitiveness:

LCK and LPL win a lot more tournaments than LEC and LCS. If victory and honor is important to you, you should consider being part of LCK or LPL

Average Income: LCS has a higher average team salary, when it comes to the top players, LEC players have the highest earnings. 

Career Length
In general, LCK and LPL are very competitive, which means you might be soon replaced by younger players. In contrast, LCK and LCS players have a longer average career.

### Now let's pick a team
Summary: merits of becoming a professional lol player: high income, shorter traning years, fames, fans

pick one lck and one lpl team to recommend join

Lck: GenG

LPL: They all sucks (I will somehow pick one later)

The idea of playing video games competitively as a salaried profession has yet to be taken seriously in mainstream culture. Yet today, being a professional gamer has become a real option with its ever-growing revenue, popularity, and opportunities. Regarding esports, League of Legends (LOL) is one of the most popular games ever. As a league of legends player, I want to put together a guide for fans and young LOL players interested in becoming professional players to make sense of what the professional LOL world looks like. The project will touch upon the impact of LOL, an overview of LOL pro players, regional differences, and ways to become a professional player.
